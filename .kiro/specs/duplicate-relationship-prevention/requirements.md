# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The family tree application currently allows duplicate relationships to be created between the same two people, leading to data inconsistency and a confusing user experience. This feature will implement duplicate relationship prevention to ensure data integrity and improve the user experience when managing family relationships.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user managing family relationships, I want the system to prevent duplicate relationships between the same two people, so that I don't accidentally create redundant or conflicting relationship data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to create a relationship between two people THEN the system SHALL check if a relationship already exists between those two people
2. IF a relationship already exists between two people THEN the system SHALL prevent the creation of a duplicate relationship
3. WHEN a duplicate relationship is attempted THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining that a relationship already exists
4. WHEN viewing existing relationships THEN the system SHALL display only unique relationships without duplicates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with existing duplicate relationships in my family tree, I want the system to help me clean up duplicate data, so that my family tree data is accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects existing duplicate relationships THEN it SHALL provide a way to identify and remove duplicates
2. WHEN removing duplicate relationships THEN the system SHALL preserve the most recently created relationship
3. WHEN duplicate relationships are removed THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the cleaned data
4. WHEN cleaning duplicates THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity in the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user editing relationships, I want to be able to modify an existing relationship type rather than creating a new one, so that I can correct relationship information without creating duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to add a relationship that would duplicate an existing one THEN the system SHALL offer to edit the existing relationship instead
2. WHEN editing an existing relationship THEN the system SHALL allow changing the relationship type
3. WHEN a relationship is modified THEN the system SHALL update the existing record rather than creating a new one
4. WHEN relationship editing is completed THEN the system SHALL refresh the relationship display to show the updated information
